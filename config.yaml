cog_bundle_version: 4

name: cogy
description: Auxiliary Cogy utilities. This is a native bundle.
long_description: |
  This bundles does two things

    1) contains the Cogy executable, a script that all Cogy-defined commands
       invocations are routed to
    2) provides a `install` command that can install the bundle that is
       generated from Cogy from your Rails application.


  Currently it's only ships as a native bundle but we may release a Docker
  version in the future.
version: "0.0.3"
config:
  notes: This bundle expects the following environment variables to be set
  env:
    - var: COGY_ENDPOINT
      description: "Used by the cogy executable and is the Cogy engine endpoint
        served by your Rails application. For example if you mounted the Cogy
        engine by doing `mount Cogy::Engine, at: 'cogy'`, then `COGY_ENDPOINT`
        should be set to 'http://your-site.com/cogy'"
commands:
  cogy:
    executable: "/srv/cogcmd/cogy/commands/cogy"
    description: This is the executable invoked by Cogy-defined commands
    long_description: |
      This command exists mainly as a placeholder so that the cogy script
      is shipped in the Relays. This is the script that Cogy-defined
      commands in your Rails application will end up invoking. So the
      `executable` config set above should match the `executable_path` option
      set in your Cogy configuration (see https://github.com/skroutz/cogy#configuration).


      What this script does is simply making a request to the Cogy endpoint
      in your Rails application, defined by "COGY_ENDPOINT" env. variable and
      return the results.
    rules:
      - "allow"
  install:
    executable: "/srv/cogcmd/cogy/commands/install"
    description: Installs a bundle from a remote location
    long_description: |
      This command was created so that we could easily install the bundle config
      generated from Cogy and served by the Rails application.


      It is typically used in conjuction with a Trigger so that installing a
      new bundle is automatically hooked in your deployment process.
    arguments: "<url>"
    examples: "cogy:install http://my-site/cogy/inventory"
    rules:
      - "allow"
