  This bundles is a requirement of the Cogy gem (https://github.com/skroutz/cogy)
  and provides the following

    1) ships the Cogy executable (ie. `commands/cogy`), a script that all
       Cogy-defined commands invocations are routed to
    2) provides a `install` command that can install the bundle that is
       generated from Cogy from your Rails application.

  This bundle only ships as a native bundle but we may release a Docker
  version in the future. This means that it is assumed you already have a
  configuration management tool set up for provisioning native bundles.
version: "0.4.0"
config:
  notes: This bundle expects the following environment variables to be set.
  env:
    - var: COGY_BACKEND
      description: |
        Used by the cogy executable and should point to the Cogy
        engine endpoint which is served by your Rails application.
        For example, if you mounted the Cogy engine by doing
        `mount Cogy::Engine, at: 'cogy'`, then it should be set to http://your-site.com/cogy"
        If you use cogy >= 0.5.1, you can ship this variable from within Cogy.
commands:
  cogy:
    executable: "/srv/cogcmd/cogy/commands/cogy"
    description: This is the executable invoked by Cogy-defined commands
    long_description: |
      This command exists mainly as a placeholder so that the cogy script
      is shipped in the Relays. This is the script that is ultimately invoked by
      all Cogy commands (which are defined in your Rails app).

      Thus, the `executable` config set above should match the
      `cogy_executable` option set in your Cogy configuration
      (see https://github.com/skroutz/cogy#configuration).

      This script simply makes an HTTP request to the Cogy endpoint in your
      Rails application (as defined by the `COGY_BACKEND` environment variable)
      and returns the response as a result.

    long_description: |
      Installs the Cogy-generated bundle config, which is served by your
      Rails application (ie. the inventory endpoint).

      It's meant to be invoked by a Cog Trigger so that the installation happens
      automatically when needed.

      See https://github.com/skroutz/cogy#installation-trigger
    examples: "cogy:install --url 'http://myapp.com/cogy'"

      url:
